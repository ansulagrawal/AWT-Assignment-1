    <h1>Canada</h1>
    <p class="text-start m-5">Canada, second largest country in the world in area (after Russia), occupying roughly the
      northern two-fifths of the continent of North America.

    </p>
    <p class="text-start m-5">Despite Canada’s great size, it is one of the world’s most sparsely populated countries.
      This fact, coupled with the grandeur of the landscape, has been central to the sense of Canadian national
      identity, as expressed by the Dublin-born writer Anna Brownell Jameson, who explored central Ontario in 1837 and
      remarked exultantly on “the seemingly interminable line of trees before you; the boundless wilderness around you;
      the mysterious depths amid the multitudinous foliage, where foot of man hath never penetrated…the solitude in
      which we proceeded mile after mile, no human being, no human dwelling within sight.” Although Canadians are
      comparatively few in number, they have crafted what many observers consider to be a model multicultural society,
      welcoming immigrant populations from every other continent. In addition, Canada harbours and exports a wealth of
      natural resources and intellectual capital equaled by few other countries.</p>
    <p class="text-start m-5">Canada is officially bilingual in English and French, reflecting the country’s history as
      ground once contested by two of Europe’s great powers. The word Canada is derived from the Huron-Iroquois kanata,
      meaning a village or settlement. In the 16th century, French explorer Jacques Cartier used the name Canada to
      refer to the area around the settlement that is now Quebec city. Later, Canada was used as a synonym for New
      France, which, from 1534 to 1763, included all the French possessions along the St. Lawrence River and the Great
      Lakes.</p>
