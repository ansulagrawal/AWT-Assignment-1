    <h1>South Africa</h1>
    <p class="text-start m-5">South Africa, the southernmost country on the African continent, renowned for its varied
      topography, great natural beauty, and cultural diversity, all of which have made the country a favoured
      destination for travelers since the legal ending of apartheid (Afrikaans: “apartness,” or racial separation) in
      1994.
    </p>
    <p class="text-start m-5">
      South Africa’s remoteness—it lies thousands of miles distant from major African cities such as Lagos and Cairo and
      more than 6,000 miles (10,000 km) away from most of Europe, North America, and eastern Asia, where its major
      trading partners are located—helped reinforce the official system of apartheid for a large part of the 20th
      century. With that system, the government, controlled by the minority white population, enforced segregation
      between government-defined races in housing, education, and virtually all spheres of life, creating in effect
      three nations: one of whites (consisting of peoples primarily of British and Dutch [Boer] ancestry, who struggled
      for generations to gain political supremacy.
