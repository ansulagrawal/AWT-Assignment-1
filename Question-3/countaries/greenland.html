    <h1>GreenLand</h1>
    <p class="text-start m-5">Greenland, the world’s largest island, lying in the North Atlantic Ocean. Greenland is
      noted for its vast tundra and immense glaciers.</p>
    <p class="text-start m-5">Although Greenland remains a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, the island’s home-rule
      government is responsible for most domestic affairs. The Greenlandic people are primarily Inuit (Eskimo). The
      capital of Greenland is Nuuk (Godthåb).</p>
    <p class="text-start m-5">More than three times the size of the U.S. state of Texas, Greenland extends about 1,660
      miles (2,670 km) from north to south and more than 650 miles (1,050 km) from east to west at its widest point.
      Two-thirds of the island lies within the Arctic Circle, and the island’s northern extremity extends to within less
      than 500 miles (800 km) of the North Pole. Greenland is separated from Canada’s Ellesmere Island to the north by
      only 16 miles (26 km). The nearest European country is Iceland, lying about 200 miles (320 km) across the Denmark
      Strait to the southeast. Greenland’s deeply indented coastline is 24,430 miles (39,330 km) long, a distance
      roughly equivalent to Earth’s circumference at the Equator.</p>
