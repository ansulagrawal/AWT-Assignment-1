      Rajasthan, meaning “The Abode of the Rajas,” was formerly called Rajputana, “The Country of the Rajputs” (sons of
      rajas [princes]). Before 1947, when India achieved independence from British rule, it comprised some two dozen
      princely states and chiefships, the small British-administered province of Ajmer-Merwara, and a few pockets of
      territory outside the main boundaries. After 1947 the princely states and chiefships were integrated into India in
      stages, and the state took the name Rajasthan. It assumed its present form on November 1, 1956, when the States
      Reorganization Act came into force. Area 132,139 square miles (342,239 square km). Pop. (2011) 68,621,012.
