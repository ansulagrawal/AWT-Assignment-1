    <h1>Madhya Pradesh</h1>
    <p class="text-start m-5">
      Madhya Pradesh, state of India. As its name implies—madhya means “central” and pradesh means “region” or
      “state”—it is situated in the heart of the country. The state has no coastline and no international frontier. It
      is bounded by the states of Uttar Pradesh to the northeast, Chhattisgarh to the southeast, Maharashtra to the
      south, Gujarat to the southwest, and Rajasthan to the northwest. The capital is Bhopal, in the west-central part
      of the state. Area 119,016 square miles (308,252 square km). Pop. (2011) 72,597,565.
    </p>
    <p class="text-start m-5">
      The elevation of Madhya Pradesh ranges from 300 to 3,900 feet (90 to 1,200 metres). In the northern part of the
      state the land rises generally from south to north, while in the southern part it increases in elevation toward
      the west. Important ranges of hills are the Vindhya Range, in the west, and its northern branch, the Kaimur Hills,
      both of which reach elevations of 1,500 feet (460 metres), and the Satpura, Mahadeo, and Maikala ranges, in the
      south, which have elevations of more than 3,000 feet (900 metres). The Dhupgarh Peak (4,429 feet [1,350 metres]),
      near Pachmarhi in south-central Madhya Pradesh, is the state’s highest point. Northwest of the Vindhya Range is
      the Malwa Plateau (1,650 to 2,000 feet [500 to 600 metres]). Other features include the Rewa Plateau, in the
      rugged eastern region of the Vindhya Range, the Bundelkhand Upland, north of the Vindhyas, the Madhya Bharat
      Plateau, in the extreme northwest, and the Baghelkhand Plateau, in the northeast.
