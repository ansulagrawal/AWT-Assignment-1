    <h1>Gujarat</h1>
    <p class="text-start m-5">
      Gujarat, state of India, located on the country’s western coast, on the Arabian Sea. It encompasses the entire
      Kathiawar Peninsula (Saurashtra) as well as the surrounding area on the mainland.
    </p>
    <p class="text-start m-5">
      The state is bounded primarily by Pakistan to the northwest and by the Indian states of Rajasthan to the north,
      Madhya Pradesh to the east, and Maharashtra to the southeast. Gujarat also shares a small segment of its
      southeastern border with the Indian union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, and, together with the Arabian Sea,
      it surrounds the territory of Daman and Diu. The coastline of Gujarat is 992 miles (1,596 km) long, and no part of
      the state is more than 100 miles (160 km) from the sea. The capital is Gandhinagar, on the outskirts of the
      north-central city of Ahmadabad (Ahmedabad)—the former capital, the largest city in the state, and one of the
      most-important textile centres in India. It was in Ahmadabad that Mohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi built his Sabarmati
      ashram (Sanskrit: ashrama, “retreat” or “hermitage”) as a headquarters for his campaigns against British rule of
      India.
