    <h1>Maharashtra</h1>
    <p class="text-start m-5">
      Maharashtra, state of India, occupying a substantial portion of the Deccan plateau in the western peninsular part
      of the subcontinent. Its shape roughly resembles a triangle, with the 450-mile (725-km) western coastline forming
      the base and its interior narrowing to a blunt apex some 500 miles (800 km) to the east. Maharashtra is bounded by
      the Indian states of Gujarat to the northwest, Madhya Pradesh to the north, Chhattisgarh to the east, Telangana to
      the southeast, Karnataka to the south, and Goa to the southwest and by the union territory of Dadra and Nagar
      Haveli and the Arabian Sea to the west.
    </p>
    <p class="text-start m-5">
      Maharashtra’s capital, Mumbai (formerly Bombay), is an island city on the western coast, connected to the mainland
      by roads and railways. Aptly called the gateway of India, Maharashtra is one of India’s biggest commercial and
      industrial centres, and it has played a significant role in the country’s social and political life.
