    <h1>Uttar Pradesh</h1>
    <p class="text-start m-5">
      Uttar Pradesh, the most populous and fourth largest state of India. It lies in the north-central part of the
      country.

      Uttar Pradesh is bordered by the state of Uttarakhand and the country of Nepal to the north, the state of Bihar to
      the east, the states of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh to the southeast, the state of Madhya Pradesh to the south, and
      the states of Rajasthan and Haryana and the national capital territory of Delhi to the west. On January 26, 1950,
      when India became a republic, the state was given its present name, Uttar Pradesh (literally, “Northern State”).
      Its capital is Lucknow, in the west-central part of the state. Area 93,933 square miles (243,286 square km). Pop.
      (2011) 199,581,477.
    <p class="text-start m-5">
      The state can be divided into two physiographic regions: the central plains of the Ganges (Ganga) River and its
      tributaries (part of the Indo-Gangetic Plain) and the southern uplands. The vast majority of Uttar Pradesh lies
      within the Gangetic Plain, which is composed of alluvial deposits brought down from the Himalayas to the north by
      the vast Ganges network. Most of that area is a featureless, though fertile, plain varying in elevation from about
      1,000 feet (300 metres) in the northwest to about 190 feet (60 metres) in the extreme east. The southern uplands
      form part of the highly dissected and rugged Vindhya Range, which rises generally toward the southeast. The
      elevation of that region rarely exceeds 1,000 feet.
