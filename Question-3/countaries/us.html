    <h1>United State of America</h1>
    <p class="text-start m-5">
      United States, officially United States of America, abbreviated U.S. or U.S.A., byname America, country in North
      America, a federal republic of 50 states. Besides the 48 conterminous states that occupy the middle latitudes of
      the continent, the United States includes the state of Alaska, at the northwestern extreme of North America, and
      the island state of Hawaii, in the mid-Pacific Ocean. The conterminous states are bounded on the north by Canada,
      on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, on the south by the Gulf of Mexico and Mexico, and on the west by the Pacific
      Ocean.
    </p>
    <p class="text-start m-5">
      The United States is the fourth largest country in the world in area (after Russia, Canada, and China). The
      national capital is Washington, which is coextensive with the District of Columbia, the federal capital region
      created in 1790.
    </p>
    <p class="text-start m-5">
      The major characteristic of the United States is probably its great variety. Its physical environment ranges from
      the Arctic to the subtropical, from the moist rain forest to the arid desert, from the rugged mountain peak to the
      flat prairie. Although the total population of the United States is large by world standards, its overall
      population density is relatively low. The country embraces some of the worldâ€™s largest urban concentrations as
      well as some of the most extensive areas that are almost devoid of habitation.
