    <h1>Brazil</h1>
    <p class="text-start m-5">Brazil, officially Federative Republic of Brazil, Portuguese República Federativa do
      Brasil, country of South America that occupies half the continent’s landmass. It is the fifth largest country in
      the world, exceeded in size only by Russia, Canada, China, and the United States, though its area is greater than
      that of the 48 conterminous U.S. states. Brazil faces the Atlantic Ocean along 4,600 miles (7,400 km) of coastline
      and shares more than 9,750 miles (15,700 km) of inland borders with every South American country except Chile and
      Ecuador—specifically, Uruguay to the south; Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia to the southwest; Peru to the west;
      Colombia to the northwest; and Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana to the north. </p>
    <p class="text-start m-5"> Brazil stretches roughly 2,700 miles (4,350 km) from north to south and from east to west
      to form a vast irregular triangle that encompasses a wide range of tropical and subtropical landscapes, including
      wetlands, savannas, plateaus, and low mountains. Brazil contains most of the Amazon River basin, which has the
      world’s largest river system and the world’s most-extensive virgin rainforest. The country contains no desert,
      high-mountain, or arctic environments.</p>
